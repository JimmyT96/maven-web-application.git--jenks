Maven Java Web App: Production CI/CD Pipeline 

Project Overview
This repository contains a high-performance Java web application managed with Maven. Originally established in 2023, it has been modernized for 2026 to serve as a blueprint for Automated DevOps. It demonstrates a "Zero-Touch" workflow from code commit to a containerized deployment on AWS EKS or EC2.

Tech Stack
Language: Java (Updated to JDK 21 LTS for performance and security).

Build Tool: Apache Maven 3.9.6

CI/CD: Jenkins 

Analysis: SonarQube 2026.1 LTA 

Artifacts: Dockerized .war deployment using Tomcat 10.1 (Jakarta EE compatible).

Infrastructure: AWS EC2 (T3-Medium optimized) or Amazon EKS.

CI/CD Workflow
Commit: Developer pushes to GitHub; Jenkins triggers via webhooks.

Verify: Maven executes unit tests and generates the artifact (mvn clean package).

Analyze: SonarQube performs SAST (Static Application Security Testing) to catch 2026-critical vulnerabilities.

Containerize: Docker builds a lean image using Multi-stage builds to minimize the attack surface.

Deploy: The image is pushed to a private registry and deployed via a rolling update.

Getting Started
1. Prerequisites
JDK 21 

Maven 3.9.6

Docker Desktop (for local testing).

2. Local Build
Bash

git clone https://github.com/JimmyT96/maven-web-application.git--jenks
cd maven-web-application
mvn clean package 
The optimized .war file will be generated in the /target folder.

3. Running with Docker
Bash

# Build the image using the hardened Dockerfile
docker build -t maven-web-app:v2 . 

# Run the container (Mapping Port 8080)
docker run -p 8080:8080 maven-web-app:v2
